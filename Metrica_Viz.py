Module for visualising Metrica tracking and event data

Data can be found at: https://github.com/metrica-sports/sample-data

UPDATE for tutorial 4: plot_pitchcontrol_for_event no longer requires 'xgrid' and 'ygrid' as inputs.

    Parameters
    -----------
        EPV: The 32x50 grid containing the EPV surface. EPV is the probability that a possession will end with a goal given the current location of the ball. 
             The EPV surface is saved in the FoT github repo and can be loaded using Metrica_EPV.load_EPV_grid()
        field_dimen: tuple containing the length and width of the pitch in meters. Default is (106,68)
        attack_direction: Sets the attack direction (1: left->right, -1: right->left)
            
    Returrns
    -----------
       fig,ax : figure and aixs objects (so that other data can be plotted onto the pitch)

    """    
    if attack_direction==-1:
        # flip direction of grid if team is attacking right->left
        EPV = np.fliplr(EPV)
    ny,nx = EPV.shape
    # plot a pitch
    fig,ax = plot_pitch(field_color='white', field_dimen = field_dimen)
    # overlap the EPV surface
    ax.imshow(EPV, extent=(-field_dimen[0]/2., field_dimen[0]/2., -field_dimen[1]/2., field_dimen[1]/2.),vmin=0.0,vmax=0.6,cmap='Blues',alpha=0.6)
