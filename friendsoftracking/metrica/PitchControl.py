Module for calculating a Pitch Control surface using MetricaSports's tracking & event data.

Pitch control (at a given location on the field) is the probability that a team will gain 
possession if the ball is moved to that location on the field. 

Methdology is described in "Off the ball scoring opportunities" by William Spearman:
http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2002.pdf

GitHub repo for this code can be found here:
https://github.com/Friends-of-Tracking-Data-FoTD/LaurieOnTracking

Data can be found at: https://github.com/metrica-sports/sample-data

Functions
----------

calculate_pitch_control_at_target(): calculate the pitch control probability for the attacking and defending teams at a specified target position on the ball.

generate_pitch_control_for_event(): this function evaluates pitch control surface over the entire field at the moment
of the given event (determined by the index of the event passed as an input)

Classes
---------

The 'player' class collects and stores trajectory information for each player required by the pitch control calculations.
