    """ calc_player_velocities( tracking_data )
    
    Calculate player velocities in x & y direciton, and total player speed at each timestamp of the tracking data
    
    Parameters
    -----------
        team: the tracking DataFrame for home or away team
        smoothing: boolean variable that determines whether velocity measures are smoothed. Default is True.
        filter: type of filter to use when smoothing the velocities. Default is Savitzky-Golay, which fits a polynomial of order 'polyorder' to the data within each window
        window: smoothing window size in # of frames
        polyorder: order of the polynomial for the Savitzky-Golay filter. Default is 1 - a linear fit to the velcoity, so gradient is the acceleration
        maxspeed: the maximum speed that a player can realisitically achieve (in meters/second). Speed measures that exceed maxspeed are tagged as outliers and set to NaN. 
        
    Returrns
    -----------
       team : the tracking DataFrame with columns for speed in the x & y direction and total speed added
